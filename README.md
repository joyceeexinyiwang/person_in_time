_During quarantine, Joyce camped out in her friend's empty apartment. She created this series of poignant self-portraits, treading lightly in her temporary quarters._

_In these snap shots, her body is keyed out to create "windows," where two videos of the same view in different time scales are overlaid._

## Story
During the first a month and a half of quarantine, I stayed in a friend’s apartment. I was originally living in a dorm, stuck in a small, half-basement room with a terrible kitchen. It was miserable so I asked to stay at my friend’s empty apartment while she was with her family in another city.

My friend’s home was full of her personality. When I first arrived, it was as if she just left — there were dishes drying on the rack, clothes in the hamper, and snacks in the fridge. I lived carefully, knowing that in a few weeks, I would leave, and hopefully I would not leave many traces behind. There was a sense of friction between the space and my body, because I was a guest here without the host. I wanted my presence to be brief and light, but as time went by, I blended with the space and felt more and more at home. It really was a cozy apartment! The friction became more of a warm touch.

In this project, I lean into the distance between my body and my temporary home. In the snap shots, my keyed-out body creates windows that allow for juxtaposition between the same space in two different time scales.

## Process
